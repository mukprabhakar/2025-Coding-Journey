## About the Repository

This repository serves as a collection of solutions to daily programming problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and other curated problem sets. Each solution is implemented in **Java** with clean, well-commented, and efficient code. The repository is a testament to my journey toward mastering algorithmic thinking and coding best practices.

---

## Goals

1. Solve the **Problem of the Day** on LeetCode consistently.
2. Practice other interesting problems to cover a wide range of topics:
   - Data Structures
   - Algorithms
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Graphs and Trees
   - String Manipulation
3. Improve coding speed and accuracy for competitive programming and technical interviews.
